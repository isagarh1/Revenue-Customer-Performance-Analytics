# Revenue-Customer-Performance-Analytics
## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end retail analytics dashboard designed to analyze revenue performance, customer behavior, and product-level drivers. The dashboard provides executive-level KPIs along with granular breakdowns across category, subscription status, demographics, seasonality, payment methods, and geographic distribution.

The objective is to surface revenue drivers, identify growth opportunities, and inform strategic decision-making using structured data analysis.

## Executive KPIs
### Metric	                    Value
- Total Revenue-	              $233K
- Total Customers-	            3,900
- Average Order Value (AOV)-	  $59.80
- Average Rating-	            3.8
- Subscription Rate-	          27%

## Key Findings:

- Revenue is highly concentrated in Clothing (45%+ of total revenue), creating dependency risk.

- Subscription customers represent 27% of users but contribute proportionally similar revenue — indicating limited monetization uplift.

- Footwear drives the highest AOV (~$62), presenting a strong cross-sell opportunity.

- Full-price transactions outperform discounted sales — margin protection strategy validated.

- Monthly male purchasers represent a disproportionately high revenue segment.

- Fall is the strongest performing season.
